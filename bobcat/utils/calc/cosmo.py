#DEFINING THE FUNCTION:
def cosmo_calc(z,a=None,b=None,c=None): #Inputs are: z, H0, WM, WV
    """
    This is the BOBcat cosmological distance calculator. It was built upon the following:
    Cosmology calculator (www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html) ala Ned Wright (www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright)
    Cosmology calculator python version (www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CC.python) ala James Schombert (abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/)
    
    Required Input values = redshift
    Additional Input values = Ho, Omega_m, Omega_vac
    
    Output values = redshift, comoving radial distance (in Mpc), luminosity distance (in Mpc), and the angular diameter distance scale (in kpc/")
    
    By default, this calculator assumes a flat universe in line with the benchmark model. Other universes can be built via custom values of WM and WV.
