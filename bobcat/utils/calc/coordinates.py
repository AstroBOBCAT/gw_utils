## coordinate_finder.py contains the code for the coord_finder() function. This function will take the name
## of an astronomical object and query the astropy database with the name. The name used in this function does
## NOT have to be the NED name of the object. The function will return the J2000 ra and dec of the object 
## in units of hmsdms as long so the object is found within astropy.
