#  MASS CALCULATIONS

""".

find_m1_m2() takes in all six mass values used to describe a binary
system. From any two out of the six values, m1 and m2 can be found. We
prioritize m1 and m2 values because calculating any of the other four
mass values is easiest from m1 and m2. Therefore, this function will
determine which two (minimum) mass values were passed to it and then
calculate m1 and m2 from there. The elif statements are put in an
order such that the easiest calculations are put at the beginning and
should complete first. This means if more than two mass values are
passed to the function, the simplest calculations will occur to find
m1 and m2 values.
